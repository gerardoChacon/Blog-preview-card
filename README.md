# Blog Preview Card

## Overview

The "Blog Preview Card" represents my inaugural foray into web development, encapsulating the lessons learned and challenges faced as I navigated through the basics of HTML and CSS. This component is designed to be a reusable, responsive preview card for blog articles, built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies.

### The Challenge

Embarking on this project as my first serious attempt at web design, I encountered several challenges:

- **Centering the Card**: Initially, using `margin: auto;` led to horizontal centering, but vertical alignment proved more elusive. The breakthrough came with the use of CSS's grid layout which allowed for both horizontal and vertical centering, demonstrating the power and flexibility of modern CSS.
- **Shadow Effect**: I initially tried to use a border to create a shadow effect. However, I soon realized that to achieve the desired look, a pseudo-element with a separate `box-shadow` was necessary, leading to a better understanding of CSS's box model and stacking context.
- **Image Sizing**: Centering the image within the card was another hurdle. Adjustments that seemed to center the image actually centered the entire section. After some research, I discovered that setting the image's width to 100% and adjusting the padding was the solution, which was a valuable lesson in responsive design.

### Key Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The card is fully responsive, thanks to the mobile-first design approach and strategic use of media queries.
- **Interactive Elements**: The title of the card becomes interactive with a hover state, showcasing dynamic styling.
- **Semantic HTML**: The project uses semantic tags for improved accessibility and SEO.
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Styling is made manageable through CSS variables, allowing for quick theme adjustments.
- **Creative Problem-Solving**: The shadow effect is created with a pseudo-element, demonstrating an innovative use of CSS for visual enhancements.
